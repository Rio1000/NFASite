                    Computers have improved drastically scene 1943. When the US government made the first electronic computer named “ENIAC”. It lacked some features that would have made it a more generally helpful machine. It used plugboards for communicating instructions to the machine; this had the advantage that, once the instructions were “programmed,” . the machine ran at electronic speed. Instructions read from a card reader or other slow mechanical device would not have been able to keep up with the all-electronic ENIAC. The disadvantage was that it took days to rewire the machine for each new problem. This was such a liability that only with some generosity could it be called programmable. On January 24, 1984, Apple came out with the Macintosh desktop computer. This computer was revolutionary in the new age of technology. The Macintosh was a smaller design, so the public could have them in their homes and use them for commercial use. This computer still can't compare to the new computers in the mid-2000s, even known they were the height of technology back then. The new computers had better processors, graphic cards, more ram, and even more high-quality screens to display information. New companies were formed, these companies were NVIDIA, AMD, Rison, and Intel. These companies have created graphics cards and processors for computers and commercial use. And have been trying to perfect the graphics card and processor to be more powerful and handle more tasks running on the computer with these tasks running at great speeds. They also try to have the graphics card render high-quality images and videos with outstanding quality. And games that have realistic lighting close to reality where light can bounce off objects and reflect off others. Computers have come a long way since the 1940s, they still have much to be worked on today.
